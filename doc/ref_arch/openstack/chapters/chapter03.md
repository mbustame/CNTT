## 3.1 Introduction
- Architectural drivers (from requirements)
- Core NFVI Software services to meet requirements (minimum set of commonly utilized services)


<a name="3.2"></a>
## 3.2 NFVI Software Services Topology
- Distribution options for control, storage, compute nodes etc. e.g.  >=3 control nodes 
  – also include options for Edge – cater for multiple sized clouds / edge?
  - Baseline versions


<a name="3.3"></a>
## 3.3 Foundation
- Baremetal cloud creation


<a name="3.4"></a>
## 3.4 Cloud Controller Services
- Highly available OpenStack Services 
- Logging / Monitoring / Alerting (should this be a separate section on its own?)
- Identity Management


<a name="3.5"></a>
## 3.5 Cloud Workload Services
- Abstraction of Compute, Storage, Network resources (this is covered in RM Chapter 3)
- Virtualisation Services
- Tenant separation (this is covered in RM Chapter 3)
